        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>Storage and Processing.</span> The information collected through our website and our products may be stored and processed in any country/region where LangGenius or its affiliated companies or service providers maintain facilities, including your region, the United States, Australia, Canada, China, and the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom). Our choice of processing location is to ensure efficient operations, improve performance, and create redundancy to protect data in the event of disruptions or other issues. We take measures to ensure that the data we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy is processed in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, regardless of where the data is located.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>International Data Transfers.</span> When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (including the UK) and Switzerland to the United States or other countries/regions where the European Commission has not determined their laws provide adequate data protection, we use legal mechanisms designed to help ensure your rights and protections, including contracts. Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States, and our affiliates, partners, third parties, and service providers operate in the United States, European Economic Area, and China. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information is protected in accordance with this privacy policy. The main safeguard relied upon by LangGenius is the Standard Contractual Clauses for Data Protection approved by the European Commission. For more information about these mechanisms, please contact us using the detailed contact information provided in the "How to Contact Us" section below.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>Keeping your information safe.</span> LangGenius cares about the security of your information and takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or your information.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>Lawful basis for processing personal information (EEA only).</span> LangGenius , is the data controller of your information.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}>This section below is specifically for you if you are located in the European EconomicArea (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will indicate this at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences, if any, if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will indicate to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}>If you have questions about the legal basis for processing or want to find out more, please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p className={s.text}><span className={s.bold}>Retention.</span> We retain personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed and for longer periods as necessary for us to comply with applicable laws. For example, we retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Products you have requested or authorized, including maintaining and improving the performance of the Products and protecting system security. We also retain personal data as needed to maintain appropriate business and financial records, protect our legal interests, resolve disputes, or comply with legal or regulatory requirements. Thereafter, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information using appropriate security measures and take appropriate steps designed to isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>Object to processing:</span> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information and request us to cease processing of it if, for example, this data is being processed for the purpose of direct marketing or where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party). Under certain circumstances, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

          <li>
            <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>Restrict the processing:</span> You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the accuracy of the personal information; (b) if our use of the data is illegal but you do not want it erased; (c) if you require us to hold the data even if we no longer need it as you require it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) if you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}><span className={s.bold}>Withdraw consent:</span> Where we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process that personal information, but we may be unable to continue providing certain products or services to you for which the personal information was sought. At the time you withdraw your consent, we will advise you if this is the case.</p>

You will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services even after you opt-out from receiving promotional messages from us. You can opt-out of some notification messages in your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

Under certain circumstances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.</p>
